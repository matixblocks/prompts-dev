1. **Code Review**

   Use the following prompt for code reviews:

   ```
   Revisá este PR buscando:
   - Memory leaks y problemas de performance
   - Casos borde sin manejar

2. **Code Migration**

   This prompt helps in migrating your React components:

   ```
   Migrá este componente de React 18 a React 19:
   - Convertí useEffect innecesarios a server components donde corresponda
   - Usá las nuevas APIs de React 19 (use, useOptimistic)
   - Mantené funcionalidad exacta
   - Explicá cada cambio importante
   ```

   Make the necessary adjustments as per your project's details.

3. **Documentation**

   When documenting a function, you can use:

   ```
   Generá documentación profesional para esta función:

   - README con ejemplos de uso
   - Diagrama de flujo en Mermaid
   - Lista de edge cases cubiertos
   ```

   Fill in specific examples and details based on your function.

4. **Performance Optimization**

   For optimizing a function, consider:

   ```
   Optimizá esta función O(n²):
   - Reducir complejidad temporal a O(n) o O(n log n)
   - Usar estructuras de datos apropiadas (Set, Map)
   ```

   Tailor this prompt to suit the function you want to optimize.
